Sometimes getting this error from dependencies in the pipeline:


Error: Could not find Chromium (rev. 1083080). This can occur if either
 1. you did not perform an installation before running the script (e.g. `npm install`) or
 2. your cache path is incorrectly configured (which is: /home/circleci/.cache/puppeteer).
